<p>First impressions are important, and this site delivers a good one it lt looks professional well built and you can see all the information you would need from the home page. The main content is photo hyperlinks with information about each one although if you know what you need there are links to the left and a small navigation bar at the top and one at the bottom. It makes sense to have the main content upfront and if you know what you need it’s easy to find and accessible. The photos allow you to know where you can see where you’re visiting. It was quick with virtually no wait time. The text and background allowed it to be readable and simple. It has a search bar and a top-down navigation bar. It is a simple white background and a webpage that repeats the same basic theme although in this case, it’s a good thing. It keeps the main content centered and resizes well. The amount of information you can find on the home page.

 <p>Looks like it was made in 2010. Links to the left and a blog text in the center. It's kind of weird because the blog text never stops going. It took a while for the content to load but it wasn’t too long. It was all readable although it was a little plain. The only way to navigate the site is through scrolling and the side links. BLACK only black. It does not respond at all to any movement of the window. It hasn’t been updated since 2013.</p>

 <p>It looks like a scam website because all that it has is four hyperlinks and one suspicious photo. It has no scheme I don’t know who made this site but it is so simple in an awful way. It makes sense because it’s all on one page. It’s a weird photo so it does nothing for the website. Considering its just four links and a photo it shouldn’t take as long as it does. It was plain just white background and four links. The only way to navigate the site is through scrolling and the side links. Four links no other things besides the photo. It was only one page no scheme just links and a photo but if you click the links the webpage after looks not as bad. It does not respond at all but then again it doesn't need to all its content is small. ONLY FOUR LINKS AND A PHOTO.</p>
